# lbPocketPals_RN

This is a React-Native version of the web lbPocketPal.com, a past collaborative hackathon project of mine. The web app is no longer in development but I seek to develop this fun concept further.

It's core feature of this application is to utilize the fun dog generating api by ElliotLandsborough [here](https://github.com/ElliottLandsborough/dog-ceo-api) into a fun fashion. Future functions will be added.
