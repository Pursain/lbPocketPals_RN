# lbPocketPals_RN

This is a React-Native version of the web lbPocketPal.com, a past collaborative hackathon project of mine. The web app is no longer in development but I seek to develop this fun concept further.

The core feature of this application is to utilize the fun dog generating api by ElliotLandsborough [here](https://github.com/ElliottLandsborough/dog-ceo-api) into something fun. Future functions will be added.

## Feature Log
###### V1.0.0
* Randomly generates one picture of random breed upon button press
* Handles async render decently with placeholder image
* Extracts breed from JSON link url
* Optimized and tested only for android

##### For reference:
* react-native-cli: 2.0.1
* react-native: 0.55.4
* use default gradle version
